Summary. 
This is the result of an old (75) newbie who is struggling to design an ESP32C3_Supermini based datalogger. 
While using I2C sensors and RTC through I2C was relatively straightforward, making the SD card module and E_Paper display work correctly required a long series of attempts because of the interfernce caused by SD Card on the E-Paper refresh.
The reasonably expected working duration of this datalogger with a single 18650 is of several months ( when getting data every thirty minutes between deepsleep periods) also because the MCP1640 DC DC step up converter is powered off during deepsleep

ESP32-C3 Battery-Powered Datalogger with E-Paper Display
üß† About This Project
This is a low-power datalogger based on the ESP32-C3 Supermini, designed to run for long periods on a single 18650 Li-Ion battery. It logs environmental data from sensors and displays information on an E-Paper screen, with data stored on an SD card. The system is optimized for deep sleep to maximize battery life.


üîã Key Features
‚Ä¢ 	ESP32-C3 Supermini with deep sleep cycles
‚Ä¢ 	MAX17048 battery monitor for voltage and state-of-charge
‚Ä¢ 	MCP1640 DC-DC boost converter (3.7V ‚Üí 5V)
‚Ä¢ 	BME280 and SHT31 sensors for temperature, humidity, and pressure
‚Ä¢ 	DS3231 RTC for accurate timekeeping
‚Ä¢ 	E-Paper display for ultra-low-power visual output
‚Ä¢ 	SD card logging of sensor data
‚Ä¢ 	GPIO-controlled power to disable boost converter during sleep

üß∞ Hardware Used


üß™ How It Works
1. 	On wake-up, the ESP32:
‚Ä¢ 	Powers the boost converter via GPIO
‚Ä¢ 	Reads battery voltage and SOC from MAX17048
‚Ä¢ 	Reads sensors (BME280, SHT31)
‚Ä¢ 	Logs data to SD card
‚Ä¢ 	Updates the E-Paper display
2. 	Then it:
‚Ä¢ 	Powers down the boost converter
‚Ä¢ 	Enters deep sleep for 1800 seconds (30 minutes)

‚ö° Power Notes
‚Ä¢ 	The datalogger works reliably when powered via:
‚Ä¢ 	The USB port of the ESP32-C3 Supermini
‚Ä¢ 	An accessory USB port, such as a USB-to-DIP adapter mounted on the PCB
‚Ä¢ 	The ESP32-C3 Supermini is a compact variant of the ESP32-C3, ideal for space-constrained designs. Its small footprint makes it perfect for portable, battery-powered applications.
